Guardrails:
1.activefence
2. Llama Guard: LLM-based Input-Output Safeguard for Human-AI Conversations
3. NeMo Guardrails -->> language used ---> Colang, a specialized modeling language used to define guardrails for Large Language Models (LLMs), primarily within the NVIDIA NeMo Guardrails framework
Use Cases:
You can use programmable guardrails in different types of use cases:

Question Answering over a set of documents (a.k.a. Retrieval Augmented Generation): Enforce fact-checking and output moderation.
Domain-specific Assistants (a.k.a. chatbots): Ensure the assistant stays on topic and follows the designed conversational flows.
LLM Endpoints: Add guardrails to your custom LLM for safer customer interaction.
LangChain Chains: If you use LangChain for any use case, you can add a guardrails layer around your chains.
Agents (COMING SOON): Add guardrails to your LLM-based agent.



I have categorized the guardrails into five big categories:

- Security and privacy
- Response and relevance
- Language quality
- Content validation
- Logic and functionality
